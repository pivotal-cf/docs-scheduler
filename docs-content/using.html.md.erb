title: Using Scheduler for PCF
owner: PCF Autoscaler and Scheduler

This topic provides instructions for using Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The service enables ad hoc and scheduled execution of PCF tasks as well as HTTP POST calls to external HTTP Services.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool or the [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) UI.

For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html). 

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

* A PCF installation with [Scheduler for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler-for-pcf) installed and listed in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) account
* (Optional) If you want to use the Scheduler for PCF CLI Plugin, you must install it on your local machine. This plugin is packaged with the tile on Pivotal Network.

## <a id='create-service'></a>Create and Bind a Service Instance

Every app and service in PCF is scoped to a [space](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#spaces). This means that an app can use a service only if an instance of the service exists in the same space.

The Scheduler for PCF service is a singleton service. Only one service instance can be created in a space.

### <a id='run-marketplace'></a>Confirm Service Availability

For apps to use a service, the service must be available in the Marketplace. To confirm you have installed Scheduler for PCF:

1. Run `cf marketplace` from the command line.
1. If the output lists `scheduler-for-pcf` in the `service` column, Scheduler for PCF is available. If the service is not available, [install](./installing.html) it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans      description
    [...]
    scheduler-for-pcf   standard   Scheduler service
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

To create an instance of the Scheduler for PCF service, run `cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`, replacing `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with a name of your choice. After you create the service instance, this name appears under `service` in the output of the `cf services` command.

See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard my-instance<br>
Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK<br>
$ cf services<br>
Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
name          service            plan    bound apps    last operation
my-instance   scheduler-for-pcf  standard              create succeeded
</pre>

You can create only one instance in a space. If you attempt to create more than one instance in a space, you receive an error response.

### <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a Scheduler instance, run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`, replacing `APP-NAME` with the name of the app you want to use the Scheduler service for and `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you provided when you ran `cf create-service`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Binding service my-instance to my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
