This topic provides instructions for managing jobs in Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="manage-jobs"></a>Manage Jobs

You can use Scheduler for PCF to schedule execution of tasks on PCF, including database migrations, emails, and batch jobs. See the following sections to learn more about creating, running, and scheduling jobs and viewing job history.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) for managing jobs, you must install the Scheduler for PCF CLI plugin on your local machine. This plugin is packaged with the Scheduler for PCF tile on <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler-for-pcf">Pivotal Network</a>. For more information, see the <a href="using.html#prereqs">Prerequisites</a> section of the Using Scheduler for PCF topic.</p>

### <a id="create-jobs"></a>Create a Job

To execute a task related to an app, create a job by running the `cf create-job APP-NAME JOB-NAME COMMAND` command, where:

  * `APP-NAME` is the app you want to execute a task against.
  * `JOB-NAME` is the name for your job.
  * `COMMAND` is the command you want to execute.
    
See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
 $ cf create-job my-app my-job "pwd"<br>
 Creating job my-job for my-app with command pwd in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
 Job Name   App Name        Command
 my-job     my-app          pwd
 OK
</pre>

### <a id="exec-jobs"></a>Execute a Job

You can execute a job manually. This is often useful to test the configuration of a job prior to scheduling it for recurring execution.

Run `cf run-job JOB-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf run-job my-job<br>
Enqueuing job my-job for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>	

### <a id="schedule-job"></a>Schedule a Job

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can schedule a job to execute at any time using a schedule expression. Scheduler for PCF requires Cron expressions in the `MIN HOUR DAY-OF-MONTH MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK` format.

You can schedule a job to execute at any time using a schedule expression. Pivotal Scheduler requires Quartz cron expressions in the `MIN HOUR DAY-OF-MONTH MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK` format. For more information on how to use this syntax, see [Scheduler Cron Syntax](syntax.html).

For example, to execute a job at noon every day, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf schedule-job my-job "0 12 ? * * "</pre>

A single job can have multiple schedules. Each schedule has a GUID to distinguish it from similar schedules.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Scheduled jobs automatically execute in UTC.</p>

### <a id="list-jobs"></a>View Jobs

You can use the cf CLI to list all jobs in a space by running `cf jobs`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf jobs<br>
Listing jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
Job Name    App Name        Command
my-job      my-app          pwd
OK
</pre>

### <a id="view-schedules"></a>View Schedules for Jobs

You can review schedules for all jobs in a space by running `cf job-schedules`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-schedules<br>
Getting scheduled jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
App Name: my-app
my-job        pwd    2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d   0 12 ? * *
OK
</pre>

### <a id="job-history"></a>View Job History

You can review job history by running `cf job-history JOB-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-history my-job<br>
Getting scheduled job history for my-job in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...

### <a id="view-logs"></a>View Logs

You can view logs for jobs by running `cf logs APP-NAME --recent`.
See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf logs my-app --recent<br>
Connected, dumping recent logs for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
