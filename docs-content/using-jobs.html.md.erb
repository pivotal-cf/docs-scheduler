This topic provides instructions for using Scheduler for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The service enables ad hoc and scheduled execution of PCF tasks.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool or the [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) UI.

For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html). 

## <a id="manage-jobs"></a>Manage Jobs

See the following sections to learn about the operations you can perform with Scheduler for PCF.

### <a id="create-jobs"></a>Create a New Job

To execute tasks related to an app, create a new job by running `cf create-job APP-NAME JOB-NAME COMMAND`:

  * `APP-NAME` is the app you want to execute a task against.
  * `JOB-NAME` is the name for your job.
  * `COMMAND` is the command you wish to execute.
    
See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
 $ cf create-job my-app my-job "pwd"<br>
 Creating job my-job for my-app with command pwd in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
 Job Name   App Name        Command
 my-job     my-app          pwd
 OK
</pre>

### <a id="list-jobs"></a>List Jobs

Use the cf CLI to list all jobs in a space by running `cf jobs`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf jobs<br>
Listing jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
Job Name    App Name        Command
my-job      my-app          pwd
OK
</pre>

### <a id="exec-jobs"></a>Execute a Job

You can execute a job manually. This is often useful to test the proper configuration of a job prior to scheduling it for recurring execution.

Run `cf run-job JOB-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf run-job my-job<br>
Enqueuing job my-job for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

### <a id="job-history"></a>View Job History

You can review job history by running `cf job-history JOB-NAME`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-history my-job<br>
Getting scheduled job history for my-job in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...

### <a id="view-logs"></a>View Logs

You can view logs for jobs by running `cf logs JOB-NAME --recent`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Scheduler jobs are executed as <a href="https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/using-tasks.html">CF Tasks</a>.</p>

See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">

### <a id="schedule-job"></a>Schedule a Job

You can schedule a job to execute at any time using a schedule expression. Scheduler for PCF requires cron expressions in the `MIN HOUR DAY-OF-MONTH MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK` format.

For example, to execute a job at noon every day, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf schedule-job my-job "0 12 * * * "</pre>

A single job can have multiple schedules. Each schedule has a GUID to help distinguish it from similar schedules.

### <a id="view-schedules"></a>View Schedules for Jobs

You can review schedules for all jobs in a space by running `cf job-schedules`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf job-schedules my-job "0 12 * * *"<br>
Getting scheduled jobs for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
App Name: my-app
my-job        pwd    2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d   0 12 * * *
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete-schedule"></a>Delete a Job Schedule  

You can delete a specific schedule by running `cf delete-job-schedule SCHEDULE_GUID`, where `SCHEDULE_GUID` is the GUID found in the output of the `job-schedules` command. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-job-schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d<br>
Really delete the schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d / 0 12 * * * and all associated history?> [yN]: y
OK
</pre>	

### <a id="delete-job"></a>Delete a Job

You can delete a job by running `cf delete-job JOB_NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-job my-job<br>
Really delete the job my-job with command pwd and all associated schedules and history?> [yN]:y
OK
</pre>
